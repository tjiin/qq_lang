- homoiconicity, lisp
- statically typed and immutable by default but can declare variables that aren't?
- middle ground between hard functional programming languages like haskell and javascript or python?

- statement : stmt ; stmt ; stmt (?)
--> if 'f' in 'foo': print('1'); print('2'); print('3')

- conditionals/ternary operator

- comprehensions/generators
- referring to object as you're creating it
