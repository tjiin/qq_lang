[x]exponents
- multiple lines
- different variable declarations
- functions
- different data types

- program structure, parsing, etc

# DIGIT? or no point going to deeper level?
# CHAR?

TODO: Implicit multiplication kind of works but '(1) (2)' would be incorrectly parsed as multiplying...
TODO: Handle assigning boolean expressions to variables

IDEA: ('case1', '1+1', eval(self[-1])) ) => ('case1', '1+1', 2)
--> assigning element while declaring in relation to other elements

- take a break then try adding lines and other data types

( 05:43:45 PM | Tue Oct 29 2019 )
- added exponents which needed new rules/patterns and order of operations update
- added more negative cases like -(-2), 1*-1 and ---(3)

( 04:25:30 PM | Wed Oct 30 2019 )
- spent last half hour getting pycharm installed and looking ok
- now fixing all suggestions
- was close to getting variables working but then things started to break again
- experimented with NO_EQUALS in parsing variable assignments for a while

( 07:20:46 PM | Wed Oct 30 2019 )
- all tests in main work, committed to new branch
- variable assignments to complex expressions seem to work
    - e.g. let num = 292.1*(0.24^(-1))
- still have 5 shift/reduce warnings
- starting work on multiple lines

- got pretty heavy into debugging, learned a lot about tracing things through the stack
- pycharm or a good IDE is absolutely necessary...
- writing unit tests for the past while, wasting a bit of time trying to be too fancy

( 11:25:34 PM | Wed Oct 30 2019 )
- found a better and simpler unit test method after trying a few
    - easy to parametrize and print all cases and results
- most tests written for where interpreter is at
- still some weird broken cases and things left hanging like ((2)(2)(2))
- can't unittest variables at this point
