- different variable declarations
- functions
- different data types

- program structure, parsing, etc

# DIGIT? or no point going to deeper level?
# CHAR?

- added exponents which needed new rules/patterns and order of operations update
- added more negative cases like -(-2), 1*-1 and ---(3)

- spent last half hour getting pycharm installed and looking ok
- now fixing all suggestions
- was close to getting variables working but then things started to break again
- experimented with NO_EQUALS in parsing variable assignments for a while
